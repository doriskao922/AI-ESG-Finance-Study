# AI Adoption and ESG Performance in the Financial Sector  

## 📘 Overview  
This repository presents research based on my Master’s dissertation for the MSc Investment Banking and Finance programme at the University of Glasgow. The project examines how the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in financial institutions influences Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance across the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union.  

As part of my collaboration experience with **FCA UK** and **Insig AI**, this study integrates sustainability analytics with AI-driven data methodologies, highlighting the intersection between technological innovation and responsible finance.  

## 🎯 Research Objectives  
- Evaluate whether AI adoption enhances ESG outcomes within financial institutions.  
- Compare ESG performance across **industries** and **jurisdictions (US, UK, EU)**.  
- Investigate whether regulatory environments moderate the AI–ESG relationship.  

## ⚙️ Methodology  
- **Data Sources:**  
  - *ESG scores* from Bloomberg Terminal (2025).  
  - *AI adoption indicators* derived using Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools from **Insig AI**, based on AI-related disclosures (2020–2024).  
- **Sample:** 138 financial institutions from the **S&P 500**, **FTSE 350**, and **STOXX 600** indices.  
- **Techniques:** Descriptive analysis, comparative analysis, and **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression**.  

## 🔍 Key Findings  
- **AI adoption significantly improves environmental (E) performance**, enhancing data-driven monitoring and environmental risk management.  
- **No significant effect** observed on social (S) or governance (G) dimensions, reflecting their qualitative and institutional complexity.  
- **Regional differences:** EU institutions outperform in environmental and social areas, while non-EU institutions show stronger governance results.  
- **Paradox of ESG weighting:** Firms placing higher emphasis on the environmental pillar often report *lower actual environmental scores*, indicating a gap between disclosure and real performance.  

## 🌿 Implications  
This research underscores both the **potential and limitations of AI** as a driver of sustainable transformation in finance. It highlights the need for:  
- **Outcome-based ESG evaluation** (focusing on real impact, not disclosure volume).  
- **Transparent and explainable AI governance frameworks**.  
- **Cross-regional comparability** in ESG measurement standards.
